In the commands ported to use\nviews, this happens after the base View struct is copied, so we are\nupdating the wrong copy of the struct.\n\nThis commit fixes this with a simple mechanical refactor: keep a pointer\nto the base View struct instead, and update all of the individual views\nto explicitly refer to that struct to access its fields and methods.\n\nThis is not a particularly satisfying solution, but I can't find\nanything clearly better.

The consumer needs to compare to the\r\nprevious value, like we do for state and context.\r\n\r\nI added a `memoizedValue` field to the context dependency type.

Alternatively, we could move these\r\ncomparisons into `readContext`, but that's a much hotter path, so I\r\nthink this is an appropriate trade off.\r\n\r\n* [Experiment] Lazily propagate context changes\r\n\r\nWhen a context provider changes, we scan the tree for matching consumers\r\nand mark them as dirty so that we know they have pending work. This\r\nprevents us from bailing out if, say, an intermediate wrapper is\r\nmemoized.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we propagate these changes eagerly, at the provider.\r\n\r\nHowever, in many cases, we would have ended up visiting the consumer\r\nnodes anyway, as part of the normal render traversal, because there's no\r\nmemoized node in between that bails out.\r\n\r\nWe can save CPU cycles by propagating changes only when we hit a\r\nmemoized component — so, instead of propagating eagerly at the provider,\r\nwe propagate lazily if or when something bails out.\r\n\r\nMost of our bailout logic is centralized in\r\n`bailoutOnAlreadyFinishedWork`, so this ended up being not that\r\ndifficult to implement correctly.\r\n\r\nThere are some exceptions: Suspense and Offscreen. Those are special\r\nbecause they sometimes defer the rendering of their children to a\r\ncompletely separate render cycle. In those cases, we must take extra\r\ncare to propagate *all* the context changes, not just the first one.\r\n\r\nI'm pleasantly surprised at how little I needed to change in this\r\ninitial implementation. I was worried I'd have to use the reconciler\r\nfork, but I ended up being able to wrap all my changes in a regular\r\nfeature flag. So, we could run an experiment in parallel to our other\r\nones.\r\n\r\nI do consider this a risky rollout overall because of the potential for\r\nsubtle semantic deviations. However, the model is simple enough that I\r\ndon't expect us to have trouble fixing regressions if or when they arise\r\nduring internal dogfooding.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is largely based on [RFC#118](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/118),\r\nby @gnoff. I did deviate in some of the implementation details, though.\r\n\r\nThe main one is how I chose to track context changes. Instead of storing\r\na dirty flag on the stack, I added a `memoizedValue` field to the\r\ncontext dependency object. Then, to check if something has changed, the\r\nconsumer compares the new context value to the old (memoized) one.\r\n\r\nThis is necessary because of Suspense and Offscreen — those components\r\ndefer work from one render into a later one. When the subtree continues\r\nrendering, the stack from the previous render is no longer available.\r\nBut the memoized values on the dependencies list are. This requires a\r\nbit more work when a consumer bails out, but nothing considerable, and\r\nthere are ways we could optimize it even further. Conceptually, this\r\nmodel is really appealing, since it matches how our other features\r\n\""reactively\"" detect changes — `useMemo`, `useEffect`,\r\n`getDerivedStateFromProps`, the built-in cache, and so on.\r\n\r\nI also intentionally dropped support for\r\n`unstable_calculateChangedBits`. We're planning to remove this API\r\nanyway before the next major release, in favor of context selectors.\r\nIt's an unstable feature that we never advertised; I don't think it's\r\nseen much adoption.\r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: Josh Story <jcs.gnoff@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n* Propagate all contexts in single pass\r\n\r\nInstead of propagating the tree once per changed context, we can check\r\nall the contexts in a single propagation. This inverts the two loops so\r\nthat the faster loop (O(numberOfContexts)) is inside the more expensive\r\nloop (O(numberOfFibers * avgContextDepsPerFiber)).\r\n\r\nThis adds a bit of overhead to the case where only a single context\r\nchanges because you have to unwrap the context from the array. I'm also\r\nunsure if this will hurt cache locality.\r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: Josh Story <jcs.gnoff@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n* Stop propagating at nearest dependency match\r\n\r\nBecause we now propagate all context providers in a single traversal, we\r\ncan defer context propagation to a subtree without losing information\r\nabout which context providers we're deferring — it's all of them.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, this is a big optimization because it means we'll never\r\npropagate to any tree that has work scheduled on it, nor will we ever\r\npropagate the same tree twice.\r\n\r\nThere's an awkward case related to bailing out of the siblings of a\r\ncontext consumer. Because those siblings don't bail out until after\r\nthey've already entered the begin phase, we have to do extra work to\r\nmake sure they don't unecessarily propagate context again. We could\r\navoid this by adding an earlier bailout for sibling nodes, something\r\nwe've discussed in the past. We should consider this during the next\r\nrefactor of the fiber tree structure.\r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: Josh Story <jcs.gnoff@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n* Mark trees that need propagation in readContext\r\n\r\nInstead of storing matched context consumers in a Set, we can mark\r\nwhen a consumer receives an update inside `readContext`.\r\n\r\nI hesistated to put anything in this function because it's such a hot\r\npath, but so are bail outs.

copying and embedding the base\nView struct in each individual view. While this allowed for easy access\nto the interface of that struct (both in the view and externally), it more\nimportantly completely broke the ability of the diagnostic printer to\noutput source code snippets.\n\nThis is because the `configSources` field on the base view is lazily set\nafter the config loader is initialized. In the commands ported to use\nviews, this happens after the base View struct is copied, so we are\nupdating the wrong copy of the struct.\n\nThis commit fixes this with a simple mechanical refactor: keep a pointer\nto the base View struct instead, and update all of the individual views\nto explicitly refer to that struct to access its fields and methods.\n\nThis is not a particularly satisfying solution, but I can't find\nanything clearly better. It might be worth exploring the alternative\napproach in the view for the new test command, which explicitly pulls\nits dependencies out of the base view, rather than retaining a full\nreference.
