That made the data flow hard to follow,\ncommonly leading to bugs, and also meant that we were forced to take\nvarious actions too early in terraform.NewContext, rather than waiting\nuntil a more appropriate time during an operation.\n\nThis (enormous) commit changes terraform.Context so that its fields are\nbroadly just unchanging data about the execution context (current\nworkspace name, available plugins, etc) whereas the main data Terraform\nworks with arrives via individual method arguments and is returned in\nreturn values.\n\nSpecifically, this means that terraform.Context no longer \""has-a\"" config,\nstate, and \""planned changes\"", instead holding on to those only temporarily\nduring an operation. The caller is responsible for propagating the outcome\nof one step into the next step so that the data flow between operations is\nactually visible.\n\nHowever, since that's a change to the main entry points in the \""terraform\""\npackage, this commit also touches every file in the codebase which\ninteracted with those APIs. Most of the noise here is in updating tests\nto take the same actions using the new API style, but this also affects\nthe main-code callers in the backends and in the command package.\n\nMy goal here was to refactor without changing observable behavior, but in\npractice there are a couple externally-visible behavior variations here\nthat seemed okay in service of the broader goal:\n - The \""terraform graph\"" command is no longer hooked directly into the\n   core graph builders, because that's no longer part of the public API.\n   However, I did include a couple new Context functions whose contract\n   is to produce a UI-oriented graph, and _for now_ those continue to\n   return the physical graph we use for those operations. There's no\n   exported API for generating the \""validate\"" and \""eval\"" graphs, because\n   neither is particularly interesting in its own right, and so\n   \""terraform graph\"" no longer supports those graph types.\n - terraform.NewContext no longer has the responsibility for collecting\n   all of the provider schemas up front. Instead, we wait until we need\n   them. However, that means that some of our error messages now have a\n   slightly different shape due to unwinding through a differently-shaped\n   call stack. As of this commit we also end up reloading the schemas\n   multiple times in some cases, which is functionally acceptable but\n   likely represents a performance regression. I intend to rework this to\n   use caching, but I'm saving that for a later commit because this one is\n   big enough already.\n\nThe proximal reason for this change is to resolve the chicken/egg problem\nwhereby there was previously no single point where we could apply \""moved\""\nstatements to the previous run state before creating a plan. With this\nchange in place, we can now do that as part of Context.Plan, prior to\nforking the input state into the three separate state artifacts we use\nduring planning.\n\nHowever, this is at least the third project in a row where the previous\nAPI design led to piling more functionality into terraform.NewContext and\nthen working around the incorrect order of operations that produces, so\nI intend that by paying the cost/risk of this large diff now we can in\nturn reduce the cost/risk of future projects that relate to our main\nworkflow actions."",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/terraform/commits/16e8c72a3f298cfbcd2b6dc6d5a62670b44962f8""}]",,,,,,,,,,
