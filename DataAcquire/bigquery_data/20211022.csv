The idea is that consumers of the Cache API can register to be informed when a given Cache instance is no longer needed so that they can perform associated cleanup tasks to free resources stored in the cache. A canonical example would be cancelling pending network requests.\r\n\r\nAn overview of the high-level changes:\r\n\r\n* Changes the `Cache` type from a Map of cache instances to be an object with the original Map of instances, a reference count (to count roughly \""active references\"" to the cache instances - more below), and an AbortController.\r\n* Adds a new public API, `unstable_getCacheSignal(): AbortSignal`, which is callable during render. It returns an AbortSignal tied to the lifetime of the cache - developers can listen for the 'abort' event on the signal, which React now triggers when a given cache instance is no longer referenced. \r\n  * Note that `AbortSignal` is a web standard that is supported by other platform APIs; for example a signal can be passed to `fetch()` to trigger cancellation of an HTTP request.\r\n* Implements the above - triggering the 'abort' event - by handling passive mount/unmount for HostRoot and CacheComponent fiber nodes.\r\n\r\nCases handled:\r\n* Aborted transitions: we clean up a new cache created for an aborted transition\r\n* Suspense: we retain a fresh cache instance until a suspended tree resolves\r\n\r\nFor follow-ups:\r\n* When a subsequent cache refresh is issued before a previous refresh completes, the refreshes are queued. Fresh cache instances for previous refreshes in the queue should be cleared, retaining only the most recent cache. I plan to address this in a follow-up PR.\r\n* If a refresh is cancelled, the fresh cache should be cleaned up."",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/sanketshah19/react/commits/fa9bea0c41ccfef5b528ef9b5517607f9f94c52a""},{""sha"":""d5b6b4b865ebf13a1eaf2342d623101056e5e197"",""author"":{""name"":""Andrew Clark"",""email"":""46f1a0bd5592a2f9244ca321b129902a06b53e03@andrewclark.io""},""message"":""Expand act warning to cover all APIs that might schedule React work (#22607)\n\n* Move isActEnvironment check to function that warns\r\n\r\nI'm about to fork the behavior in legacy roots versus concurrent roots\r\neven further, so I'm lifting this up so I only have to fork once.\r\n\r\n* Lift `mode` check, too\r\n\r\nSimilar to previous commit.

Those tests didn't require\r\nact, anyway, because in a legacy root, all tasks are synchronous except\r\nfor `useEffect`.\r\n\r\nHowever, in a concurrent root, nearly every task is asynchronous. Even\r\ntasks that are synchronous may spawn additional asynchronous work. So\r\nall updates need to be wrapped with act, regardless of whether they\r\noriginate from a hook, a class, a root, or any other type of component.\r\n\r\nThis commit expands the act warning to include any API that triggers\r\nan update.\r\n\r\nIt does not currently account for renders that are caused by a Suspense\r\npromise resolving; those are modelled slightly differently from updates.\r\nI'll fix that in the next step.\r\n\r\nI also removed the check for whether an update is batched. It shouldn't\r\nmatter, because even a batched update can spawn asynchronous work, which\r\nneeds to be flushed by act.\r\n\r\nThis change only affects concurrent roots. The behavior in legacy roots\r\nis the same.\r\n\r\n* Expand act warning to include Suspense resolutions\r\n\r\nFor the same reason we warn when an update is not wrapped with act,\r\nwe should warn if a Suspense promise resolution is not wrapped with act.\r\nBoth \""pings\"" and \""retries\"".\r\n\r\nLegacy root behavior is unchanged."",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/zys-contrib/react/commits/d5b6b4b865ebf13a1eaf2342d623101056e5e197""},{""sha"":""3c4c1c4703e8f7362370c44a48ac9348229e3791"",""author"":{""name"":""Andrew Clark"",""email"":""46f1a0bd5592a2f9244ca321b129902a06b53e03@andrewclark.io""},""message"":""Remove warning for dangling passive effects (#22609)\n\nIn legacy mode, a test can get into a situation where passive effects are\r\n\""dangling\"" — an update finished, and scheduled some passive effects,\r\nbut the effects don't flush.\r\n\r\nThis is why React warns if you don't wrap updates in act. The act API is\r\nresponsible for flushing passive effects. But there are some cases where\r\nthe act API (in legacy roots) intentionally doesn't warn, like updates\r\nthat originate from roots and classes. It's possible those updates will\r\nrender children that contain useEffect. Because of this, dangling\r\neffects are still possible, and React doesn't warn about it.\r\n\r\nSo we implemented a second act warning for dangling effects.\r\n\r\nHowever, in concurrent roots, we now enforce that all APIs that schedule\r\nReact work must be wrapped in act.
