When there\r\nare pending passive effects, it should always be a non-zero value,\r\nbecause it represents the lanes used to render the effects.\r\n\r\nBut it turns out that `root.finishedLanes` isn't always correct.\r\nSometimes it's `NoLanes` even when there's a new commit.\r\n\r\nI found this while investigating an internal bug report. The only repro\r\nI could get was via a headless e2e test runner; I couldn't get one in an\r\nactual browser, or other interactive environment. I used the e2e test to\r\nbisect and confirm the fix. But I don't know yet know how to write a\r\nregression test for the precise underlying scenario.

The reason is that, before 530027a,\r\n`root.finishedLanes` was only used by the DevTools profiler, which is\r\nprobably why we had never noticed any issues.

only accepts the keyword TF2021 that\nis intended to represent \""the edition of the Terraform language as defined\nin 2021\"".\n\nThat argument also defaults to TF2021 if not set, so in practice there's\nno real reason to set this today, but this minimal validation today is\nintended to give better feedback to users of older Terraform versions in\nthe event that we introduce a new language

(#1697)\n\nThis PR aims to resolve the undesired dependencies between DifferenceWithIdealStateGauge metric and the PERSIST_XXXXXX_ASSIGNMENT configuration. Before the change, if the assignment is not persisted, then the metric will report incorrect data.\r\nTo fix the issue, the calculation must be moved from the ExternalViewComputeStage to the BestPossibleStateCalcStage. Because the Best Possible State is only available in the BestPossibleStateCalcStage assuming the PERSIST_XXXXXX_ASSIGNMENT option is not turned on. In addition to the main logic migration, other changes listed following are required to ensure multi-thread safty.\r\n1. Concurrent control the EV cache since it will now be read in the BestPossibleStateCalcStage in addition to the ExternalViewComputeStage.\r\n2. Minor changes in the diff computing logic for the corner cases since the Best Possible State state mapping is not exactly the same as IdealState persist assignment.\r\n3. Cleanup PersistAssignmentStage logic so it won't modify the IdealState cache anymore. It is supposed to be read-only.\r\n4. Test cases are modified to cover the changes. Also the metric is now reporting correct result in some corner cases such as all the nodes are disabled. The test cases which are testing based on the wrong behavior have been fixed."",""distinct"":false,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/commits/5eae4451c3cd658b6e607fd9864a62fc2482d47a""},{""sha"":""35b5ec15c6fa0839a4f1e34c34ca798f151d3f15"",""author"":{""name"":""Huizhi Lu"",""email"":""346e675a546e9e1e06d7bff0342f8e21bbdb2c81@users.noreply.github.com""},""message"":""Add option to continue checks on failures for stoppable api (#1689)\n\nThis commit provides an option in Helix stoppable check API, such that when the option is used, Helix will always perform all checks and return all failed checks.

(#1697)\n\nThis PR aims to resolve the undesired dependencies between DifferenceWithIdealStateGauge metric and the PERSIST_XXXXXX_ASSIGNMENT configuration. Before the change, if the assignment is not persisted, then the metric will report incorrect data.\r\nTo fix the issue, the calculation must be moved from the ExternalViewComputeStage to the BestPossibleStateCalcStage. Because the Best Possible State is only available in the BestPossibleStateCalcStage assuming the PERSIST_XXXXXX_ASSIGNMENT option is not turned on. In addition to the main logic migration, other changes listed following are required to ensure multi-thread safty.\r\n1. Concurrent control the EV cache since it will now be read in the BestPossibleStateCalcStage in addition to the ExternalViewComputeStage.\r\n2. Minor changes in the diff computing logic for the corner cases since the Best Possible State state mapping is not exactly the same as IdealState persist assignment.\r\n3. Cleanup PersistAssignmentStage logic so it won't modify the IdealState cache anymore. It is supposed to be read-only.\r\n4. Test cases are modified to cover the changes.

While this allowed for easy access\nto the interface of that struct (both in the view and externally), it more\nimportantly completely broke the ability of the diagnostic printer to\noutput source code snippets.\n\nThis is because the `configSources` field on the base view is lazily set\nafter the config loader is initialized. In the commands ported to use\nviews, this happens after the base View struct is copied, so we are\nupdating the wrong copy of the struct.\n\nThis commit fixes this with a simple mechanical refactor: keep a pointer\nto the base View struct instead, and update all of the individual views\nto explicitly refer to that struct to access its fields and methods.\n\nThis is not a particularly satisfying solution, but I can't find\nanything clearly better. It might be worth exploring the alternative\napproach in the view for the new test command, which explicitly pulls\nits dependencies out of the base view, rather than retaining a full\nreference.
